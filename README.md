# 🧑‍💻 Face Recognition Attendance System

## 📌 Overview

This project is a real-time **Face Recognition Attendance System** developed using **Python**, **TensorFlow/Keras**, and **OpenCV**. The system uses deep learning (ResNet50) for accurate face detection and recognition, allowing automated attendance logging through a live webcam feed. A custom data collection module was also implemented to gather and store face data for enrolled users.

## 🗂️ Dataset

The dataset is built manually using a custom face data collection module.  
Live images are captured using a webcam and stored for training.  
Each user has a labeled folder containing multiple images for robust model training.
